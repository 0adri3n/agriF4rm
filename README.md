### For more informations about the game, take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/akira-trinity/agriF4rm/wiki">Wiki</a> !


## Installation

**Via <a href="https://0adri3n.itch.io/agrif4rm">itch.io</a>**

**OR**

Go to the <a href="https://github.com/akira-trinity/agriF4rm/releases">releases</a> page and download the last version in .zip.

Extract it and start ```agriF4rm.exe```

IF U DON'T EXTRACT IT, THE .EXE WILL NOT FIND THE CONFIG FILES.

Windows can block it because I use a translator for Python to exe, and he don't rlly like it :P

You can also download the source code and use it with Python (download the used modules before !) :
```bash
python agriF4rm.py
```
