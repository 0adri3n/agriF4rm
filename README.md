## <p align="center"> Manage your fields like a real f4rmer. Recruit agricultors, upgrade your fields and sell your wheat.</p>

## How to play

- Create ur first field.

- For every new field u create, u'll have 1k$ for free to start to play.

- So recruit agricultors, and now u can farm !

- When u have a lot of wheat and the selling price is interesting, sell it and try to roll some agricultors ! [500$/roll]

- Ur rentability is going to increase and u'll farm more and more wheat !

## Installation

Go to the <a href="https://github.com/akira-trinity/agriF4rm/releases">releases</a> page and download the last version in .zip.

Extract it and start ```agriF4rm.exe```

IF U DON'T EXTRACT IT, THE .EXE WILL NOT FIND THE CONFIG FILES.

Windows can block it because I use a translator for Python to exe, and he don't rlly like it :P

You also download the source code and use it with Python (download the used modules before !) :
```bash
python agriF4rm.py
```
